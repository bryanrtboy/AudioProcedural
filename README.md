# AudioProcedural

A very simple procedural audio system. It has a metronome and sets a schedule for when the audio should play, based on bpm and number of beats per segment. It does not generate audio, but uses audio clips to play sounds. Multiple audio sources are created to allow sounds to be layered, otherwise popping and clicking would occur when the audiosource is suddenly asked to play a new clip.
